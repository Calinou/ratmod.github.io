If you are building this documentation it is done with mkdocs. You must use the master branch for the build as github won't allow using other branches for github pages on the main organization page:

    mkdocs gh-deploy -b master

Use the 'edit' branch for editing/pushing changes etc. The master branch is only for the pushed build.
