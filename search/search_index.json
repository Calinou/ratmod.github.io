The Team Queue System There is now a queue system available for team-based modes. The intention of this system is to make sure the teams have equal numbers. It only allows people to join in pairs, which ensures that joining players cannot create unequal teams. This is not yet on by default and it is a vote: \\cv custom queues All people waiting in queue will be shown on the scoreboard. Red \"queue\" text means the player is waiting to join the red team. Blue text for blue team. White text is for those who auto-joined. All people waiting in queue will be spectating the game and will have a message on their screen \"Waiting to join team (red/blue) Joining Games When the queue system is turned on, this is how it handles a few common situations: Situation: A player wants to be ready to play... A good way to indicate that you want to play is just to join. Other spectators can then see on the scoreboard that you want to play and which team you want to join. As soon as someone else joins the opposite team or auto-join, you will enter the game. Situation: spectators want to join the game... If someone from spectators tries to join a team, they will go into the queue. For example, Player A joins red and is in queue for red. When Player B joins blue, they will both be added to the game. If Player B accidentally joins red, both players will be in the queue for the red team. Without the queue system, both players would be on team red and team red would win! Balancing In addition to the queues, the vote also enables a re-balancing system that makes sure the teams have equal numbers of players even if players leave during the game: Situation: A player leaves a team... If the teams become unequal because one or more of the players leave, then the game will equalize the player numbers. The server will wait for a few moments before taking action. In XTERM/CA this balancing will happen after the current round is finished. In CTF it will happen after a few moments. The server will also display messages in the console and on the screen that this will happen. Who is put into the queue? The last player who joined will be put back into his team's queue. In the case that all players joined at the same time it will be the one with the lowest score. Situation: Two players want to switch teams The queue system makes it easier to handle players switching to opposite teams. Player A switches from blue to red and will be in the red queue. If someone doesn't switch very soon from red to blue, the server will equalize the number of players - moving a red player to the queue.","title":"Callvote Reference"},{"location":"callvote-reference.html#server-manual","text":"Ratmod servers have a variety of callvotes to change game modes or turn on/off features.

You may not need to change anything at all. Not all of the settings listed here are available in the game menu so it is recommended to set up a config file in the ratmod directory. Name it autoexec.cfg . This file will be automatically loaded when you are in ratmod. In that file, write one setting per line. To bind a command to a key or mouse button use bind . Write it in your config file with the following format: bind <some key> <some command> Example: bind HOME ready To set a CVAR setting in your config file, write with the following format: set <cvar name> <setting> Example: set model sarge To use a command directly in the in-game console, it must be preceeded with a slash: \\command or /command . Personalization Be unique. Set your nickname by using set name \"yourname\" . Also set your model with set model <modelname> . Use the body/head format to set the head differently. Example: set model beret/sarge Personalize your rail color with a hue value from 0-360. Examples: set color1 H240 (rail core) set color2 H140 (rail trail) Helpful Binds and Commands There are several commands that provide utilities or actions for gameplay. Getting Help and Info Display the Message of the Day / Help \\motd \\help Print a link to the documentation \\doc Show the physics rules for the current server \\rules Participating in Games A true ninja is always ready: bind HOME ready - Toggle between \"ready\" and \"unready\" state when there is warmup. Commands for Joining Teams or Spectating: \\team f = free for all team or red/blue team depending on balance \\team r = red team \\team b = blue team \\team s = spectator \\team q = queue (for duel gametype or when the queue system is on) \\team n = notready (queued in duel, but not selected for next game) \\team a = afk (away from keyboard) Spectator commands: \\followauto Automatically cycle spectating through players. It also switches to flag carriers automatically in CTF. \\game <1-5> select which game to watch. This only works for multi-tournament server while you are in spectator mode. Calling for timeout: bind PAUSE pause bind INS unpause Items and Gameplay Drop the currently held item Example: bind m drop If this is enabled by the server you will drop flags, weapons or ammo. Displaying and Playing Taunts \\taunt will print a list of all taunts \\taunt <tauntname> will play a taunt from the list Pings to mark a Location, Enemy, or Warning The pings are designed to be a communication tool between team mates. Text-based messages can be difficult to see and read quickly. On the other hand, a visual ping with a sound is quickly understood. This can easily be used in combination with voice communication. The pings will be placed in the spot where your crosshairs are pointed at. There are two binds to use: bind <key> +ping All of these pings will be shown to your teammates and they will hear a ping sound. If it is out of their field of view, a pointer will show up in their HUD (on the sides) showing them the direction of the ping. These pings are meant to draw attention to something, whether it be to \"go there\", or \"enemy is over here\" or \"the flag is over there\" etc. If you point at an empty area (wall or floor), this will show a location ping to your teammates. If you ping in close proximity to an enemy, the icon will change automatically to indicate that an enemy is there. If you ping in close proximity to your flag in CTF, a flag ping will be shown to your teammates. If you are carrying the flag and die, using the bind will show your teammates where the dropped flag is. Using +ping right after you die will also produce a localized X and sound for nearby players. bind <key> +pingwarn This will show an \"X\" icon with an error-type sound. Unlike +ping , this is not global - it is not shown on HUD and the sound will not be heard far away. It is intended for communicating to players close to you. Use this to warn your teammates of some danger. It can mean \"Don't go there\", \"Stop\", \"Caution!\" etc. Here are what the icons look like, but in game they have some visual effects (scale and fade etc): Check the Ping Icon Cusomization section for customizing the ping settings. Drop token in Treasure Hunt gametype: Example: bind MOUSE5 placeToken Give up (Tournament gametype only) \\gg Voting Using the map vote menu \\mv will open the menu \\mv <filter> will open the menu with an applied filter. Example: \\mv aggressor will show all the maps containing the string \"aggressor\" This is the screen that pops up with \\mv : List all available votes \\callvote \\cv (short version) \\cv custom list all available custom votes configured by the server Change Arena Example \\arena 1 This depends on the map. Try number 0-8 This is only available for Rocket Arena mode with compatible maps. CVAR Utilities Reset all ratmod cvars USE WITH CAUTION, THIS WILL RESET ALL OF YOUR MOD SETTINGS Use \\resetcfg Show all modified client game cvars Those cvars beginning with \"cg_\" \\cgconfig Field of View and Zoom Field of View (FOV) Settings set cg_fov <value> to set your normal FOV. Zoom Settings set cg_zoomfov <value> to set your zoom fov. set cg_zoomToggle 1 enables +zoom to toggle zoom set cg_zoomAnimScale 2 increases the zoom animation speed (2x normal) set cg_zoomAnim - set to 0 to turn off zoom animation. set cg_zoomfovTmp - utility for scripting zoom fov. [needs more] set cg_specShowZoom 1 enables ability to see when players are zooming while you are spectating. Zoom Scopes Ratmod has a zoomscope available for machine gun and rail gun. To enable them use set cg_drawZoomScope 1 . There are a few settings available to alter the appearance of the scopes: set cg_zoomScopeSize will change the size (try 0.8 for smaller) change the color for each using HSV. Example: set cg_zoomScopeMGColor \"H60 1.0 0.5\" and set cg_zoomScopeRGColor \"H120 1.0 0.5\" By default the colors are green for the rail scope and yellow for the machine gun scope. Note: By default OA uses a zoom animation and the zoom scope will appear when that animation has finished - fully zoomed in. If you would like your zoom to be at full zoom instantly and also the scope to appear instantly set cg_zoomanim 0 Forcing Models and Brightskins There are several options available to force models and colors for models. Forcing Models Sarge and smarine each have a \"gray\" skin for brightshell and brightoutline overlays: set cg_teamModel sarge/gray for your team set cg_enemyModel smarine/gray for the enemy Alternatively, the \"bright\" skins are available for better performance (but don't look as good). set cg_teamModel sarge/bright set cg_enemyModel smarine/bright Set cg_forceModel to 1 to visually force other players have the same model as yours (for non-team based modes). This is usually used for performance. If you wish to see your team mate's own models, you must set cg_teamModel to an empty value ( \"\" ). Bright Shells/Outlines Caution: If you enable everything (which is the default) then the \"brightest\" version of skins that the server allows will be used. If the server allows outlines and shells, you will see shells (unless you disable them). For most players there is no reason to change any of these settings. Brightmodel or brightshells have to be allowed by the server for this to work. On servers set up for casual play, these settings will not have any effect.* set cg_brightShells 1 enables bright shells set cg_brightShells 2 is an alternative bright shell style. cg_brightShellAlpha controls the transparency of the bright shells (use for example 0.8) use set cg_brightOutline 1 for bright player outlines. To use this cg_brightShells must be 0 . Some players may like this more for casual games. Forcing Colors Note Forcing colors only works when the server configuration allows it. These colors apply when cg_teamModel or cg_enemyModel are set to a bright model (smarine/bright or sarge/bright) or when brightshells are enabled. There are three ways to specify a color: Color names : \"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"green\", \"cyan\", \"blue\", \"pink\" and \"white\". Color numbers from 1-8 (corresponding to the above). HSV format for precise colors. Example \"H125 1.0 1.0\" for green. Hue can be between 0 and 360, saturation/value from 0.0 to 1.0. If you want your team and enemy colors to always be the same, you can force them: set cg_enemyColor \"green\" will make the enemy green. set cg_teamColor \"orange\" will make your team orange. Note: if you do not force your team color, then default team hues are used. This is useful for example if you want to have your team color red when on the red team. Blue when on the blue team. The following defaults are use when cg_teamColor is set to \"\" (no value). set cg_teamHueRed 0 set cg_teamHueDefault 125 set cg_teamHueBlue 210 The following will, if set, override cg_enemyColor / cg_teamColor for the respective body parts: set cg_enemyLegsColor \"\" set cg_teamLegsColor \"\" set cg_enemyTorsoColor \"white\" set cg_teamTorsoColor \"\" Head Colors Automatically assign distinct head color (per team) by setting: set cg_enemyHeadColorAuto 1 set cg_teamHeadColorAuto 1 If the above values are set to 0 you can force the head colors: set cg_enemyHeadColor \"yellow\" set cg_teamHeadColor \"orange\" Appearance of Corpses Darken corpses with: set cg_enemyCorpseValue 0.25 set cg_teamCorpseValue 0.25 Desaturate corpses: set cg_enemyCorpseSaturation 0.75 set cg_teamCorpseSaturation 0.75 Sounds Note Forcing sounds is only allowed if forcing bright models is allowed by the server. On servers set up for casual play, these settings will not have any effect. Player Sounds It is possible to force player sounds. This is helpful to distinguish who is who when you don't have a visual. Here are examples: set cg_mySound sarge - your sounds will be sarge set cg_teamSound beret - team sounds will be beret set cg_enemySound tony - enemy sounds will be tony Player Footsteps You may also force the footstep sounds. There are several options: -1 = default, based on player's model 0 = normal footsteps 1 = boot footsteps 2 = flesh bootsteps (merman) 3 = mech bootsteps (smarine) 5 = energy bootsteps (ayumi) Examples for forcing footsteps: set cg_myFootsteps 1 (yours) set cg_teamFootsteps 3 (team sounds) set cg_enemyFootsteps 2 (enemy sounds) Announcer Ratmod has a new set of vocal announcements. You can switch back to the original OA announcements if you prefer with set cg_announcer \"\" . Use treb's voice with set cg_announcer \"treb\" and if you only want treb's voice for the new awards use set cg_announcer \"\" and set cg_announcerNewAwards \"treb\" . Other Sound Settings set cg_teamChatBeep 1 - Toggle the chat beeps from your team. These are from any team you are on (red, blue, or spectator) set cg_chatBeep 1 - Toggle chat beep sounds on or off set cg_music 0 - Toggle music on or off set cg_hitsound 1 - Toggle wether or not hit sounds are played when you hit an enemy with your weapon. HUD Status Bar The status bar shows your health, ammo, and armor amounts among other things. Use cg_ratStatusbar with these different values: 0 = old-school OA statusbar 1 = flag on the left 2 = flag on right 3 = minimalistic version 4 = futuristic statusbar with health/armor bars in the center, ammo bar on the left. Also enables new powerup display 5 = similar to 4, but vertically flipped cg_drawHabarBackground 1 - gives a background for the health/armor bar in the futuristic HUD. Weapon Bar The weapon bar will show you which weapons you have, which weapon is selected, and depending on the weapon bar style, how much ammo you have. Use set cg_alwaysWeaponBar 1 to always show the weapon bar. If you want to change the style try set cg_weaponBarStyle 13 or 14 for a horizontal weapon bar. 12 for vertical. There are 16 different styles in total. Awards Display set cg_drawRewards 1 will show the awards you get immediately, with different awards appearing side-by-side. The announcements will be played in rapid succession. Set this to 2 to use the old OA way of showing awards slowly one after another. Set it to 0 to disable showing awards. Low or Empty Ammo Indicator set cg_drawAmmoWarning 1 will show you a low ammo warning use set cg_emptyIndicator 1 to show a box around the crosshairs when the selected weapon is out of ammo Damage Taken Indicator There are some different options to show when you are receiving damage and what direction it is coming from: set cg_hudDamageIndicator 1 shows the damage indicator on the sides of the screen when getting hit set cg_hudDamageIndicator 2 shows a damage indicator around crosshair set cg_hudDamageIndicator 3 is the old OA damage indicator (blood splatter) You can make some adjustments to the damage indicator with these cvars: cg_hudDamageIndicatorScale - change the scale (0.0-1.0) cg_hudDamageIndicatorAlpha Change the transparency (0.0-1.0) cg_hudDamageIndicatorOffset - change the offset from centre Crosshairs A variety of crosshairs have been added for the sake of variety but also to address some clarity issues. Another point was to provide some varying sizes of similar crosshairs. (There is an in-game mechanism to adjust the crosshair size but that unfortunately does not always result in a crisp crosshair.) One crosshair for all weapons If you just want to use one crosshair, you can set it with the UI menu or you have two cvars to play with: cg_drawcrosshair [num] and cg_crosshairsize [num] . Configure crosshair for each weapon You must first use set cg_differentCrosshairs 1 and then customize each crosshair with the following: set cg_ch1 [num] - gaunt set cg_ch2 [num] - machine gun set cg_ch3 [num] - shotgun set cg_ch4 [num] - grenade launcher set cg_ch5 [num] - rocket launcher set cg_ch6 [num] - lightning gun set cg_ch7 [num] - rail gun set cg_ch8 [num] - plasma gun set cg_ch9 [num] - bfg set cg_ch10 [num] - grapple set cg_ch11 [num] - nail gun set cg_ch12 [num] - proximity mine set cg_ch13 [num] - chain gun Note: The default size for each crosshair is 30 . If you want to adjust that, append size to the cvars listed above. Example: set cg_ch2size 35 . Note: Clarity and sharpness of crosshairs seems to be affected by texture quality settings. Low settings will result in crosshairs that aren't sharp. It's recommended to use high quality texture settings. Note: Original Open Arena crosshairs are not available now in ratmod. Crosshair Health Indicator set cg_crosshairhealth 1 - When enabled the crosshairs will change color depending on your health. Custom crosshair colors are disabled if this is on. 2 is a variant. Use 0 for no change in color (and also to allow custom colors) Crosshair Color Set the color with these ( Note: requires set cg_crosshairhealth to be 0 . ): set cg_crosshairColorRed 1.0 set cg_crosshairColorGreen 1.0 set cg_crosshairColorBlue 1.0 Crosshair Hit Indicator This feature will change the color of your crosshair if you hit another player. set cg_crosshairHit 1 to enable the feature set cg_crosshairHitColor \"H300 1.0 1.0\" - this is the color it will be when you hit with maximum damage (HSV color format). You can also specify a color by name (\"red\"). Different styles are available: set cg_crosshairHitStyle 1 - indicates the damage via the difference between the normal crosshair color and the hit color set cg_crosshairHitStyle 2 - varies the hue of the hit color based on the damage (positive direction) set cg_crosshairHitStyle 3 - varies the hue of the hit color based on the damage (negative direction) Game Information Game Timer The timer is important and shows you the time since the match started: set cg_drawTimer 1 - enables the timer (it is off by default). set cg_timerPosition 0 - places the timer on the top right set cg_timerPosition 1 - places the timer in the top middle set cg_timerScale <value> - use this to change the size of the timer (1.2 will be bigger) set cg_timerAlpha <value> - can be used to change the transparency (0.0-1.0) Movement Speed set cg_drawSpeed 1 - will show you how fast you are moving cg_speedScale - change the size cg_speedAlpha - change the transparency Frames Per Second (FPS) It is not covered here, but it is very important to adjust certain settings in order to have a constant FPS.

Extermination (XTERM) Xterm (Extermination) is a spin-off of Clan Arena (CA/Elimination) and inspired by \"Wipeout\" from Diabotical. Some of the game mechanics are the same as CA, but some are different. There are two teams and players spawn with all weapons and a full health and armor stack. A round will finish when all players of one team are dead. When a team reaches the maximum points (5 by default), they win. When a player dies in Xterm they will respawn. Each team has their own respawn delay and the initial delay is 5 seconds. Every time a player dies that delay for that team increases by 5 seconds. The respawn timer for your own team is shown on the right side of the screen and also in the team overlay for each player. When someone respawns there is a sound played. The growing delay between spawns is what can often give one team an advantage over the other. When there is one player left on either team, the game will give an announcement. This game is a spin-off of CA but ideally shouldn't be played in the same way. Different strategies and communication are required to win. When choosing maps for Xterm consider that if the map is too big or too small it is likely not ideal for this mode. If this game type is available on a server, you can change to it by voting \\cv custom xterm Treasure Hunter (TH) This is a team game of hide and seek with tokens. At the beginning of a match there is a Hiding Phase during which each player on each team has tokens to hide around the map. After the time runs out for the hiding phase, the Seeking Phase begins. The team that finds the other teams tokens first will win. Or the team that has the most tokens after the time runs out. There is quite a lot of time given for both phases, but it can be quite a challenge to find some tokens. This mode has the map clipping turned off so you are able to go in many strange places not normally allowed (for example underneath maps etc). Players often utilize rocket jumps and etc in order to get to difficult places on maps. A few special things to remember: To place a token you need to use the command \\placetoken . Bind it to a key: \\bind <key> placetoken Tokens cannot be hidden in places where you normally die (in lava etc). If you are not happy with your token placement during the hiding phase, you can destroy it by shooting it and try again When you discover a token during the seeking phase, to \"catch\" it you can touch it with your player model or you can shoot it. Tokens have a good deal of health so it is faster to touch it. The location of your teams tokens is shown with a diamond icon that can be seen from anywhere. You cannot see the other team players but you can hear them. Vote for this game type if it available with \\cv custom th FFA with All Weapons (FFA_AW) This is a cross between Clan Arena and Free For All (Deathmatch). Players spawn with all weapons and a full stack of health and armor. There are no items on the map. In order to win you need to reach the frag limit or have the most points when the timer is up.
