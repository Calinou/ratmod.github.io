# Medal Reference

Stock medal icons have been redesigned, and a good number of medals have been added. Many of these are designed to reward *good* skill and if you achieve something during play it will show up in your HUD with an announcement.

At the end of a match, it is possible to see the medals that all players received by pressing `TAB` while viewing the scoreboard.
