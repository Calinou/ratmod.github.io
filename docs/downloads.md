## Source Code

You can find the source code for the mod [hosted on github.com](https://github.com/rdntcntrl/ratoa_gamecode).

If you want to build the mod yourself, you should build it from the [ratarena_release](https://github.com/rdntcntrl/ratarena_release) repository, which will include the assets.
