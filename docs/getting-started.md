# Getting Started with Ratmod

Ratmod is all set up for you with great defaults. To make an enemy model green and team model pink:

- `\cg_enemyColor green`
- `\cg_teamColor pink`

If you want the default team colors back, use a blank value: `""`

Some people ask: [Why don't brightskins/shells/outlines show up even though I configured them?](faq.md#why-dont-brightskinsshellsoutlines-show-up-even-though-i-configured-them)

To see an overview of the available votes, type `\cv` in the game console.

To see custom votes available, type `\cv custom` in the game console. You can also use the vote menu (Esc -> Call Vote -> Custom Vote)

It would be to read through these [Helpful Binds and Commands](config-command-reference.md#helpful-binds-and-commands).

For further customization, start with the [Config and Command Reference](config-command-reference.md).
