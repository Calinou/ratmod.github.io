## Getting Started with Ratmod

Ratmod is all set up for you with great defaults. Make sure that auto-download is on and when you go on a Ratmod server everything will be set for you. 

To make an enemy model green and team model pink:

- `\cg_enemyColor green`
- `\cg_teamColor pink`

If you want the default team colors back, use a blank value: `""`

Some people ask: [Why don't brightskins/shells/outlines show up even though I configured them?](faq.md#why-dont-brightskinsshellsoutlines-show-up-even-though-i-configured-them)
